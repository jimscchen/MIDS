*[first lines]
*'''Jane Foster''': Wait for it.
*'''Darcy Lewis''': Can I turn on the radio?
*'''Jane Foster''': No!
*'''Erik Selvig''': Jane, you can't keep doing this.
*'''Jane Foster''': The last seventeen occurrences had been predictable to this second! [she checks through her notebook]
*'''Erik Selvig''': Jane, you're an astrophysicist, not some storm chaser!
*'''Jane Foster''': I'm telling you, there's a connection between these atmosphere disturbances and my research. Eric, I...I wouldn't ask you to fly out here if I wasn't absolutely sure. [going onto the roof of their vehicle to get a clearer look] God!
*'''Erik Selvig''': I thought you said it was a subtle aurora!
*'''Jane Foster''': [to Darcy] Go!
*[Darcy suddenly starts the car and speeds towards the light]
*'''Jane Foster: '''[to the body that's just dropped to the ground from the sky] Do me a favor and don't be dead! Please! [looking up at the sky] Where did he come from?
*'''Odin''': [voice over] Once mankind accepted a simple truth; that they were not alone in this universe. Some worlds man believed home to their Gods. Others they new to fear. From around the cold and darkness came the Frost Giants. Threatening to plunge the mortal world into a new ice age.
*[humans are attacked and frozen by Frost Giants]
*'''Odin: '''[voice over] But humanity would not face this threat alone.
*[Asgardians led by Odin arrive on Jotunheim]
*'''Odin: '''{voice over] Our armies drove the Frost Giants back into the heart of their own world. The cost was great. In the end, their king fell. And the source of their power was taken from them.
*[Odin strikes down Laufey, and steals the Casket of Ancient Winters]
*[Asgard is shown]
*'''Odin: '''[voice over] With the last great war ended, we withdrew from the other worlds and returned home at the realm eternal, Asgard. And here we remain as the beacon of hope. Shining out across the stars. And though we have fallen into man's myths and legends, it was Asgard and it's warriors that brought peace to the universe.
*[Odin, young Thor, and young Loki are walking through the treasure vault]
*'''Odin: '''But the day will come when one of you will have to defend that peace.
*'''Young Loki''': Do the Frost Giants still live?
*'''Young Thor''': When I'm king, I'll hunt the monsters down and slay them all! Just as you did, father.
*'''Odin''': A wise king, never seeks out war. But...he must always be ready for it. [he walks away and the boys run to catch up with him]
*'''Young Thor''': I'm ready, father.
*'''Young Loki''': So am I!
*'''Odin''': Only one of you can ascend to the throne. But both of you were born to be kings!
*[at Thor's coronation]
*'''Odin: '''Thor Odinson, my heir, my first born. So long entrusted with the mighty hammer, Mjöllnir, forged in the heart of a dying star. It's power has no equal! It's a weapon to destroy or as a tool to build. It is a fit companion for a king. I have defended Asgard, and the lives of the innocent across my realms in the time of the great beginning.
*[during Thor's coronation, Frost Giant freeze pillars in the vault]
*'''Odin''': Do you swear to guard the nine realms?
*'''Thor''': I swear.
*'''Odin''': And do you swear to preserve the peace?
*'''Thor''': I swear.
*'''Odin''': Do you swear to cast aside your selfish ambition and to pledge yourself only to the good of the realms?
*'''Thor''': I swear!
*'''Odin''': And on this day, I Odin, All-Father, will proclaim you... [after finding out the Frost Giants have broke into their weapons vault]
*[the Frost Giants steal take out the guards]
*'''Odin: '''Frost Giants.
*[the Frost Giants take the Casket of Ancient Winters]
*[Odin hits his spear against the floor which echoes]
*[in the vault, the Destroyer comes out of its room and takes out the Frost Giants, takes back the Casket, sets it back in its original place, and enters its room again]
*[Thor, Odin, and Loki have entered the vault]
*'''Thor''': The Jotuns must pay for what they've done!
*'''Odin''': They have paid. With their lives. To destroy it at its work, the Casket is safe and all is well.
*'''Thor''': All is well? They broke into the weapons vault! If the Frost Giants have stolen even one of these relics...
*'''Odin''': They didn't!
*'''Thor''': Well I want to know why?
*'''Odin''': I have a truce with Laufey, King of the Jotuns.
*'''Thor''': He just broke your truce! They know you are vulnerable.
*'''Odin''': What action would you take?
*'''Thor''': March into Jotunheim as you once did. Teach them a lesson. Break their spirits so they'll never dare to cross our borders again.
*'''Odin''': You're thinking only as a warrior.
*'''Thor''': Well, this was an act of war!
*'''Odin''': It was the act of but a few, doomed to fail.
*'''Thor''': Look at how far they got!
*'''Odin''': We will find the breach in our defenses and it will be sealed.
*'''Thor''': As King of Asgard...
*'''Odin''': But you're not King! Not yet.
*[Thor is then seen flipping banquet tables and sits down on a step]
*[Loki rounds the corner to join him]
*'''Thor''': It's unwise to be in my company now, brother. This was to be my day of triumph.
*'''Loki''': It'll come. In time. If it's any consolation, I think you're right. About the Frost Giants, about Laufey, about everything. If they found a way to penetrate Asgard's defenses once, who's to say they won't try again. Next time with an army.
*'''Thor''': Exactly!
*'''Loki''': There's nothing you can do without defying father.
*[Volstagg, Frandral, Hogun, and Sif walk in]
*'''Volstagg: '''What happened in here?
*'''Loki''': There's nothing you can do without defying father.
*[Thor gives him a knowing look]
*'''Loki''': No! No, no, no, no, no! I know that look!
*'''Thor''': It's the only way to ensure the safety of our borders!
*'''Loki''': Thor, it's madness!
*'''Volstagg''': Madness? What sort of madness?
*'''Thor''': We're going to Jotunheim.
*'''Fandral''': What? This isn't like a journey to earth, where you summon a little lightning and thunder, the mortals worship you as a God! This is Jotunheim.
*'''Thor''': My father fought his way into Jotunheim. Defeated their armies and took their casket! We would just be looking for answers.
*'''Sif''': It is forbidden!
*'''Thor''': My friends, have you forgotten all that we have done together? Fandral, Hogun, who led you into the most glorious battles?
*'''Hogun''': You did.
*'''Thor''': And Volstagg, to delicacies so succulent you though you'd died and gone to Valhalla?
*'''Volstagg''': You did.
*'''Thor''': Yes! And who proved wrong all who scoffed at the idea that a young maiden could be one of the fiercest warriors this realm has ever known?
*'''Sif''': I did!
*'''Thor''': True, but I supported you, Sif.
*[he turns to look at all of the]
*'''Thor: '''My friends, we're going to Jotunheim.
*[they are seen riding to the Bifrost]
*'''Loki''': Good Heimdall?
*'''Heimdall''': You're not dressed warmly enough. Do you think that you can deceive me?
*'''Loki''': You must be mistaken...
*'''Thor''': Enough! Heimdall, may we pass?
*'''Heimdall''': Never has an enemy slipped my watch until this day. I wish to know how that happened?
*'''Thor''': Then tell no one where we have gone until we've returned. Understand?
*[Thor walks passed Heimdall, the others follow behind and Volstagg turns to Loki]
*'''Volstagg''': What happened? Silver tongue turned to lead?
*[the others laugh]
*'''Heimdall''': Be warned. I will honor my sworn oath to protect this realm as its gatekeeper. If you return threatens the safety of Asgard by Frost, will remain closed to you. And you'll be left to die in the cold waste of Jotunheim.
*'''Volstagg''': Couldn't you just leave the bridge open for us?
*'''Heimdall''': To leave the bridge open would unleash the full power of the Bifrost and destroy Jotunheim, and with you upon it.
*'''Thor''': I have no plans to die today.
*'''Heimdall''': None do.
*[Heimdall sends them to Jotunheim]
*[as they enter Jotunheim]
*'''King Laufey''': You have come a long way to die, Asgardians?
*'''Thor''': I am Thor Odinson.
*'''King Laufey''': We know who you are.
*'''Thor''': How did your people get into Asgard?
*'''King Laufey''': The house of Odin is full of traitors.
*'''Thor''': Do not dishonor my father's name with your lies!
*'''King Laufey''': Your father is a murderer and a thief! And why have you come here? To make peace? You long for battle. You crave it! You're nothing but a boy trying to prove himself a man.
*'''Thor''': Well this boy has grown tired of your mockery.
*'''Loki''': Thor, stop and think! Look around you. We're out numbered!
*'''Thor''': Know your place, brother!
*'''King Laufey''': You know not what your actions would unleash. I do. Go, now! While I still allow it.
*[he comes walks closer to Thor and Loki]
*'''Loki''': We will accept, your most gracious offer.
*[Thor looks at Laufey, reluctant to leave]
*'''Loki:''' Come on, brother!
*[as Thor reluctantly turns to leave the Frost Giant]
*'''Frost Giant Sentry''': [mocking] Run back home, little princess.
*'''Loki''': Damn!
*[Thor's hammer extends and he hits the Frost Giant with it and their battle begins]
*[just as the Frost Giants have cornered Thor and his friends Odin appears]
*'''Thor''': Father! Let's finish them together!
*'''Odin''': Silence!
*[King Laufey suddenly extends in front of Odin]
*'''King Laufey''': All-Father. You look weary.
*'''Odin''': Laufey, end this now.
*'''King Laufey''': Your boy sought this out.
*'''Odin''': You're right. These are the actions of a boy. Treat them as such. You and I can end this, here and no. Before there's further bloodshed.
*'''King Laufey''': We are beyond diplomacy now, All-Father. He'll get what he came for. War and death.
*'''Odin''': So be it.
*[Laufey's icy armor extends and he hits Odin off his horse]
*'''Thor''': Why did you bring us back?
*'''Odin''': Do you realize what you've done? What you've started?
*'''Thor''': I was protecting my home!
*'''Odin''': You cannot even protect your friends! How can you hope to protect a kingdom?
*'''Thor''': There won't be a kingdom to protect if we are afraid to act! The Jotuns must learn to fear me! Just as they once feared you.
*'''Odin''': That's pride and vanity talking, not leadership. You've forgotten everything I taught you! About a warriors patience.
*'''Thor''': While you wait and be patient, the nine realms laugh at us! The old ways are done! You'd stand giving speeches while Asgard falls!
*'''Odin''': [shouting] You are a vain, greedy, cruel boy!
*'''Thor''': [shouting] And you are an old man and a fool!
*'''Odin''': Yes, I was a fool. To think you were ready.
*'''Loki''': Father...
*'''Odin''': [shouts at Loki] Nay! Thor Odinson, you have betrayed the express command of your King. Through your arrogance and stupidity, you have opened these peaceful realms and innocent lives to the horror and desolation of war!
*[he steps forward to stand in front of Thor]
*'''Odin: '''You are unworthy of these realms! You are unworthy of your title!
*[he strips him of his medals and cape]
*'''Odin: '''You're unworthy...of the loved ones you have betrayed. I now take from you, you're power!
*[he takes Thor's hammer]
*'''Odin: '''In the name of my father!
*[with Thor's hammer he destroys the shield on one of Thor's arm]
*'''Odin: '''And his father.
*[use the hammer to destroy another one of Thor's shields]
*'''Odin: '''I, Odin, All-Father, curse you out!
*[with Thor's hammer he banishes Thor out of Asgard] [after he's just banished Thor]
*'''Odin: '''Whosoever holds of this hammer, if you be worthy, you posses the power of Thor.
*[he throws Thor's hammer out of Asgard]
*[after Thor has crash landed onto their truck and is lying wounded on the ground]
*'''Darcy Lewis''': Whoa! Does he need CPR? Cause I totally know CPR.
*[Thor looks and Jane]
*'''Jane Foster''': Where did he come from? You all right?
*[Thor gets up from the ground]
*'''Thor''': Hammer? Hammer?!
*'''Darcy Lewis''': Yeah, we can tell you're hammered! That's pretty obvious.
*'''Erik Selvig''': Jane, we'll have to take him to the hospital.
*'''Thor''': Father!
*'''Jane Foster''': He is fine! Look at him.
*'''Thor''': Heimdall? I know you can hear me! Open the Bifrost!
*'''Jane Foster''': [to Erik, as they watch Thor] Hospital! You go. I'll stay.
*'''Thor''': You? What realm is this? Álfheimr? Niflheimr?
*'''Darcy Lewis''': New Mexico!
*[Darcy hold her taser gun at him]
*'''Thor''': You dare threaten me, Thor! You're so puny...
*[Darcy shoots him with her taser gun. He shakes and falls, Erik and Jane look at Darcy in shock]
*'''Darcy Lewis''': What? He was freaking me out!
*[the screen shows Darcy and Erik putting him in the car]
*'''Erik Selvig: '''Darcy, next time you taze somebody, make sure they're in the car first, okay?
*[at County Hospital]
*'''Admission Nurse''': Name?
*'''Jane Foster''': He said, it was, Thor.
*[she spells out his name as she types on her computer]
*'''Admission Nurse''': T-H-O-R. And your relationship to him?
*'''Jane Foster''': I've never met him before.
*'''Darcy Lewis''': Until she hit him with her car.
*'''Jane Foster''': I grazed him. But she tasered him.
*'''Darcy Lewis''': Yes, I did.
*[meanwhile in room Thor is in]
*'''Erik Selvig''': You don't think this was just a magnetic storm, do you?
*'''Jane Foster''': Look? The lensing round these edges, it's characteristics of an Einstein-Rosen Bridge.
*'''Darcy Lewis''': A what?
*'''Erik Selvig''': [to Darcy] I thought you were a science major.
*'''Darcy Lewis''': Political science.
*'''Jane Foster''': She was the only applicant.
*'''Erik Selvig''': [to Darcy] An Einstein-Rosen Bridge, is a theoretical connection between two different points in space...
*'''Jane Foster''': A wormhole.
*'''Darcy Lewis''': Hmmm.
*'''Jane Foster''': Erik, look? What do you see? [hands him a photo]
*'''Erik Selvig''': Stars.
*'''Jane Foster''': Yeah. But not our stars! See, this is the star alignment for our quadrant at this time of year. And unless some minor decided to take a day off, these are someone else's constellations.
*'''Darcy Lewis: '''Uh, guys, you might wanna see this.
*[they walk over and see a picture of what appears to be Thor in a cloud]
*'''Jane Foster: '''I just lost my most important piece of evidence. Typical!
*'''Darcy Lewis''': Now what?
*'''Jane Foster''': We find him.
*'''Erik Selvig''': [referring to what Thor had done to the hospital as he'd escaped] Did you see what he did in there? I'm not sure finding him is the best idea.
*'''Jane Foster''': Well, our data can't tell us what it was like to be inside that event and he can. So, we're gonna find him.
*'''Darcy Lewis''': Okay.
*'''Erik Selvig''': You're gonna look all over New Mexico then?
*[she starts her car]
*'''Jane Foster''': Exactly!
*[just as she's reversing her car, Thor appears behind her car and she hits him, she rushes out to see him]
*'''Jane Foster: '''I'm so sorry! I swear I'm not doing this on purpose!
*'''Darcy Lewis''': [watching as Thor get dressed] You know, for a crazy, homeless person, he's pretty cut. Sorry, I tased you!
*'''Thor''': [pointing to the name tag on the shirt he's about to put on] What is this?
*'''Jane Foster''': Oh!
*[she takes off the name tag from the T-shirt]
*'''Jane Foster: '''My ex! Good with patience and bad with relationships! Uh...they're the only clothes I had that would fit you.
*'''Thor''': They will suffice.
*[he walks away from her]
*'''Jane Foster''': You're welcome!
*'''Thor''': This mortal form has grown weak. I need sustenance!
*'''Volstagg''': We should have never let him go!
*'''Sif''': There was no stopping him.
*'''Fandral''': At least he's been banished, not dead. Which is what we'd all be if that guard hadn't told them where we'd gone.
*'''Volstagg''': How did the guard even know?
*'''Loki''': I told him.
*'''Fandral''': What?
*'''Loki''': I told him to go to Odin after we'd left. He should be flogged for taking so long. We should have never reached Jotunheim.
*'''Volstagg''': You told the guard?!
*'''Loki''': I saved our lives. And Thor's. I had no idea father would banish him for what he did.
*'''Sif''': Loki, you must go to the All-Father and convince him to change his mind.
*'''Loki''': And if I do, then what? I love Thor more dearly than any of you, but you know what he is. He's arrogant, he's reckless, he's dangerous! You saw how he was today. Is that what Asgard needs from it's King?
*[he walks off]
*'''Sif''': [referring to Loki] He may speak for the good of Asgard, but he's always been jealous of Thor.
*'''Volstagg''': We should be grateful to him. He saved our lives.
*'''Hogun''': Laufey said there were traitors in the house of Odin. A master of magic could bring three Jotuns into Asgard.
*'''Fandral''': Loki has always been one for mischief, but you're talking about something else entirely.
*'''Loki''': Am I cursed?
*'''Odin''': No.
*'''Loki''': What am I?
*'''Odin''': You're my son.
*'''Loki''': What more than that?
*[he walks towards Odin]
*'''Loki: '''The casket wasn't the only thing you took from Jotunheim that day, was it?
*'''Odin''': No. In the aftermath of the battle, I went into the temple, and I found a baby. Small for a giants offspring. Abandoned. Suffering. Left to die. Laufey's son.
*'''Loki''': Laufey's son?
*'''Odin''': Yes.
*[after finding out he's Laufey's son]
*'''Loki''': Why? You were knee deep in Jotun blood. Why would you take me?
*'''Odin''': You were an innocent child.
*'''Loki''': No! You took me for a purpose. What was it?
*[Odin does not reply]
*'''Loki: '''[shouting] Tell me?!
*'''Odin''': I thought we could unite our kingdoms one day. Bring about an alliance. Bring about permanent peace, through you.
*'''Loki''': What?
*'''Odin''': But those plans no longer matter.
*'''Loki''': So, I'm no more than another stolen relic? Locked up, here, until you might have use of me!
*'''Odin''': Why do you twist my words?
*'''Loki''': You could have told me what I was, from the beginning! Why didn't you?
*'''Odin''': You're my son. I wanted only to protect you from the truth.
*'''Loki''': What? Because I...I...I...I'm the monster that parents tell their children about at night?
*'''Odin''': No! No!
*'''Loki''': It all makes sense now. Why you favored Thor, all these years! Because no matter how much you claim to love me, you could never have a Frost Giant sitting on your throne of Asgard!
*[as Loki is shouting at him Odin slowly falls down, Loki realizes Odin has fallen ill]
*'''Loki: '''Guards! Guards, please help!
*[as Thor is stuffing his face with food]
*'''Jane Foster''': How'd you get inside that cloud?
*'''Darcy Lewis''': Also how could you eat an entire box of Pop Tarts and still be this hungry? [Thor doesn't reply instead finishes chewing and drink his coffee]
*'''Thor''': This drink, I like it!
*'''Darcy Lewis''': I know, it's great, right?
*[Thor suddenly throws his coffee cup to the ground shattering the mug]
*'''Thor''': Another!
*[after Thor has smashed his coffee cup in the diner]
*'''Jane Foster''': What was that?
*'''Thor''': It was delicious! I want another.
*'''Jane Foster''': Well, you could have just said so!
*'''Thor''': I just did.
*'''Jane Foster''': No. I mean ask nicely!
*'''Thor''': I meant no disrespect.
*'''Jane Foster''': All right. Well, no more smashing. Deal?
*'''Thor''': You have my word.
*'''Jane Foster''': Good.
*'''Darcy Lewis''': Oh, my God! This is goin' on Facebook. [to Thor] Smile?
*[Thor smiles as Darcy holds up her cell phone to take his picture]
*[as Thor sets out to get his hammer]
*'''Jane Foster''': Where you going?
*'''Thor''': Fifty miles west of here.
*'''Jane Foster''': Why?
*'''Thor''': To get what belongs to me.
*'''Jane Foster''': Oh, so you own a satellite now?
*'''Thor''': It's not what they say it is.
*'''Jane Foster''': Well, what ever it is, the government seems to think it's theirs. So you just intend to go in there and take it?
*'''Thor''': Yes. If you take me there now, I'll tell you everything you wish to know.
*'''Jane Foster''': Everything?
*'''Thor''': Yes. All the answers you seek will be yours, once I reclaim Mjöllnir.
*'''Darcy Lewis''': Meowmeow? What's Meowmeow?
*'''Erik Selvig''': Please, don't do this.
*'''Jane Foster''': You saw what I saw last night. This is no coincidence. We have to find out what's on that crater.
*'''Erik Selvig''': But I'm not talking about the crater. I'm talking about him.
*'''Jane Foster''': But he's promising us answers.
*'''Erik Selvig''': He's delusional. Listen to what he's saying. He's talking about Mjöllnir, and Thor and Bifrost! It's the stories I grew up with as a child.
*'''Jane Foster''': I'm just gonna drive him. That's it!
*'''Erik Selvig''': He's dangerous, Jane.
*'''Jane Foster''': I'm sorry. But I can't take you.
*'''Thor''': Then this is where we say goodbye.
*[he takes her hand and kisses it]
*'''Jane Foster''': Uh...thank you!
*'''Thor''': Jane Foster. Erik Selvig. Darcy. Farewell.
*[after the SHIELDS Agents have taken all her equipment]
*'''Jane Foster''': Years of research. Gone.
*'''Darcy Lewis''': They even took my iPod.
*'''Erik Selvig''': What about the backups?
*'''Jane Foster''': They took our backups. They took the backups of our backups. They were extremely thorough.
*'''Darcy Lewis''': Just downloaded like thirty songs onto there.
*'''Jane Foster''': Could you please, stop with your iPod!
*'''Sif''': All-Father, we must speak with you urgently!
*[they suddenly see Loki sitting in Odin's throne]
*'''Loki''': My friends.
*'''Fandral''': Where's Odin?
*'''Loki''': Father has fallen into the Odinsleep. Mother fears he may never awaken again.
*'''Sif''': We would speak with her.
*'''Loki''': She has refused to leave my father's bedside. You can bring your urgent matter to me.
*[he stands]
*'''Loki: '''Your King.
*[they bow]
*'''Sif''': My King, we would ask that you end Thor's banishment.
*'''Loki''': My first command cannot be to undo the All-Father's last. We're on the brink of war with Jotunheim. Our people need a sense of continuity in order to feel safe in these difficult times. All of us must stand together. For the good of Asgard.
*[Sif stands to say something, but Fandral stops her]
*'''Fandral''': Yes, of course.
*'''Loki''': Good. You then awaiten for my word.
*'''Volstagg''': If I may, beg the indulgence of your majesty to perhaps reconsider...
*'''Loki''': We're done!
*[walking into a pet shop]
*'''Thor''': I need a horse!
*'''Pet Store Clerk''': We don't have horses. Just dogs, cats, birds.
*'''Thor''': Then give me one of those large enough to ride. [as Jane is taking Thor to get his hammer]
*'''Jane Foster''': I've never done anything like this before. Have you ever done anything like this before?
*'''Thor''': Many times. But you're brave to do it.
*'''Jane Foster''': Well, they just stole my entire life's work. I didn't really have much left to lose.
*'''Thor''': But you're clever.
*'''Jane Foster''': Thanks.
*'''Thor''': Far more clever than anyone else on this realm.
*'''Jane Foster''': Realm? Realm?
*'''Thor''': You think me strange?
*'''Jane Foster''': Yeah, I do!
*'''Thor''': Good strange, or bad strange?
*'''Jane Foster''': I'm not quite sure yet. But who are you? Really?
*'''Thor''': You'll see soon enough.
*'''Jane Foster''': You promised me answers.
*'''Thor''': What you seek, it's a bridge.
*'''Jane Foster''': Like an Einstein-Rosen Bridge?
*'''Thor''': More like a rainbow bridge.
*'''Jane Foster''': God, I hope you're not crazy! [as they watch Odin sleep]
*'''Loki''': I never get used to seeing him like this.
*'''Frigga''': He has put it off for so long now. But I fear.
*'''Loki''': How long will it last?
*'''Frigga''': I don't know. This time it's different. We were unprepared.
*'''Loki''': So why did he lie?
*'''Frigga''': He kept the truth from you, so that you would never feel different. You are our son, Loki. And we your family. We mustn't lose hope that your father will return to us. And your brother.
*'''Loki''': What hope is there for Thor?
*'''Frigga''': There's always a purpose to everything your father does.
*'''Thor''': Now stay here. Once I have Mjöllnir, I will return the items they've stolen from you. Deal?
*'''Jane Foster''': No. Look what's down there? You think you're just gonna walk in, grab our stuff, and walk out?
*'''Thor''': No. I'm gonna fly out. [he leaves her] [after Thor was caught by the SHIELD agents when he failed to get his hammer]
*'''Erik Selvig''': He committed a crime! He's in jail!
*'''Jane Foster''': I can't just leave him there!
*'''Erik Selvig''': Why?
*'''Jane Foster''': You didn't see what I saw!
*'''Darcy Lewis''': Look! Look! It's Meowmeo. [she shows the picture of Mjöllnir from the book]
*'''Jane Foster''': Where'd you find this?
*'''Erik Selvig''': The children's section. I just wanted to show you how silly his story was.
*'''Jane Foster''': But you're the one who's always pushing me to chase down every possibility, every alternative!
*'''Erik Selvig''': I'm talking about science, not magic!
*'''Jane Foster''': Well magic's just science that we don't understand yet; Arthur C. Clarke.
*'''Erik Selvig''': Who wrote science fiction.
*'''Jane Foster''': A precursor to science fact!
*'''Erik Selvig''': In some cases, yes.
*'''Jane Foster''': Well, if there is an Einstein-Rosen Bridge, then there's something on the other side. And advanced being could have crossed it!
*'''Erik Selvig''': Oh, Jane.
*'''Agent Coulson''': [interrogating Thor] You made my men, some of the most highly trained professionals in the world, look like a bunch of minimum wage mall cops. That's hurtful. In my experience it takes someone who's received similar training to do what you did to them. Why don't you tell me where you received your training? Pakistan? Chechnya? Afghanistan? [Thor just sits silently staring ahead] You know, you strike me more as the soldier of fortune type. Where was it? South Africa? Certain groups pay very well for a mercenary like you. Who are you? [Thor just looks at him silently] One way or another we'll find out what we need to know. We're good at that. [his beeper goes off] Don't go anywhere. [he leaves the room] [Loki appears in front of Thor in the interrogation room]
*'''Thor''': Loki, what are you doing here?
*'''Loki''': I had to see you.
*'''Thor''': What's happened? Tell me? Is it Jotunheim? Let me explain to father.
*'''Loki''': Father is dead.
*'''Thor''': [in shock] What?
*'''Loki''': You're banishment. The threat of a new war. It was too much for him to bear. You mustn't blame yourself. I know that you loved him. I tried to tell him so, but he wouldn't listen. So cruel to put the hammer within your reach, knowing that you could never lift it. The burden of the throne has fallen to me now.
*'''Thor''': Can I come home?
*'''Loki''': The truce with Jotunheim is conditional upon your exile.
*'''Thor''': Yes, but...couldn't we find a way to...
*'''Loki''': Your mother has forbidden your return. This is goodbye, brother. I'm so sorry.
*'''Thor''': No. I...I am sorry. Thank you for coming here.
*'''Loki''': Farewell. [he turns and leaves just as Agent Coulson enters the room again]
*'''Thor''': Goodbye.
*'''Agent Coulson''': Goodbye? I just got back. His name is Donald Blake?
*'''Erik Selvig''': Doctor Donald Blake.
*'''Agent Coulson''': You have dangerous co-workers, Doctor Selvig.
*'''Erik Selvig''': He was distraught when he found out that you'd taken all of our research. That was years of his life, gone! You can understand how a man can go off like that. A big faceless organization like yours, coming in with their Jackbooted thugs and... [Coulson gives Erik a look] That's how he put it.
*'''Agent Coulson''': That still doesn't explain how he managed to tear through our security.
*'''Erik Selvig''': Steroids! He's a bit if a fitness nut.
*'''Agent Coulson''': [looking at the screen with Thor's picture on Donald Blake's ID card] It says here that he was an MD.
*'''Erik Selvig''': Well, he is! Or he...he was. He switched careers and became a Physicist. A b..b...brilliant Physicist. He's a...he's a wonderful man. He's a man in pain.
*'''Thor''': You know, I had it all backwards. I had it all wrong.
*'''Erik Selvig''': Was that a bad thing, finding out that you don't have all the answers? You start asking the right questions.
*'''Thor''': For the first time in...in my life, I have no idea what I'm supposed to do.
*'''Erik Selvig''': If anyone is ever going to find his way in this world, you have to start by getting it that he doesn't know where the hell he is.
*'''Thor''': Thank you, for what you've done.
*'''Erik Selvig''': Don't thank me. I only did it for Jane. Her father and I taught at University together. He was a good man. He never listened.
*'''Thor''': Neither did I. My father was trying to teach me something. But I was too stupid to see it.
*'''Erik Selvig''': I don't know if you're delusional or if you're putting some kind of con. I don't care. Just care about her. I've seen the way she looks at you.
*'''Thor''': I swear to you, I...I mean her no harm.
*'''Erik Selvig''': Good. In that case, I'll buy you another round. And you leave town tonight. [Thor nods his head]
*'''King Laufey''': [to his Frost Giant guards as Loki walks up to him] Kill him.
*'''Loki''': After all I've done for you?
*'''King Laufey''': So you're the one who showed us the way into Asgard.
*'''Loki''': That was just a bit of fun really. To ruin my brother's big day. And to protect the realm from his idiotic rule for a while longer.
*'''King Laufey''': I will hear you.
*'''Loki''': I will conceal you and a handfold of your soldiers, lead you into Odin's chambers and you can slay him where he lies.
*'''King Laufey''': Why not kill him yourself?
*'''Loki''': I suspect that the Asgardians would not take kindly to a King who had murdered his predecessor. Once Odin is dead I will return the casket to you. And you can return Jotunheim to all it's uh...glory.
*'''King Laufey''': I...accept.
*'''Loki''': [after he's returned from seeing King Laufey in Jotunheim] What troubles you gatekeeper?
*'''Heimdall''': I turned my gaze upon you in Jotunheim but could neither see you or hear you.
*'''Loki''': You were shrouded from me like the Frost Giants had entered this realm.
Perhaps your senses have weakened after your many years of service.
*'''Heimdall''': Or perhaps someone has found a way to hide that which he does not wish me to see.
*'''Loki'''': You have great power, Heimdall. Did Odin ever fear you?
*'''Heimdall''': No.
*'''Loki''': And why is that?
*'''Heimdall''': Because he is my King. And I'm sworn to obey him.
*'''Loki''': He was your King. And you are sworn to obey me now. Yes? [Heimdall give him a long look]
*'''Heimdall''': Yes.
*'''Loki''': Then you'll open the Bifrost to no one. Until I have repaired the damage that my brother has done.
*'''Jane Foster''': [sitting around a camp fire] I come up here sometimes when I can't sleep, or when I'm trying to reconcile particle data or when Darcy's driving me crazy. I come up here a lot actually, now that I think about it. I'm really glad you're safe.
*'''Thor''': You've been very kind to me. I...I have been far less grateful than you deserve.
*'''Jane Foster'''': Well, I hit you with my car a couple times, so I think that kind of even things out.
*'''Thor''': Perhaps I had it coming. [he returns her research notebook to her] What's wrong?
*'''Jane Foster''': SHIELD, whatever they are, they're doing everything in their power to make sure this research never sees the light of day.
*'''Thor''': No, Jane. Listen to me, you must not give up. You must finish what you started.
*'''Jane Foster''': Why?
*'''Thor''': Because you're right. Here, look? [he takes her notebook and opens it] You're ancestors called it magic, and you call it science. Well, I come form a place where they're one and the same thing.
*'''Jane Foster''': [watching as he draws in her notebook] What is that?
*'''Thor''': My father explained it to me like this, that your world is one of the nine realms of the cosmos. Linked to each other by the branches of Yggdrasil. The worlds tree. Now you see it everyday without realizing. The images glimpsed through uh...what did you call it? This...uh this hooble telescope.
*'''Jane Foster''': Hubble.
*'''Thor''': Hubble telescope. [they both laugh]
*'''Jane Foster''': Tell me more.
*'''Thor''': So the nine realms. Now there is Midgard, which is earth. There's Alfheimr, Vanaheimr, Jotunheim and Asgard. And that's were I come from.
*'''Fandral''': Our dearest friend banished. Loki on the throne. Asgard on the brink of war. Yet you've managed to consume four wild boar, six pheasants, a side of beef and two casks of ale! Shame on you! Don't you care! [he throws his drink]
*'''Volstagg''': [shouting] Do not mistake my appetite for apathy!
*'''Sif''': Stop it! Both of you! Stop. [pushes Fandral away from Volstagg] We all know what we have to do.
*'''Hogun''': We must go. We must find Thor.
*'''Fandral''': It's treason.
*'''Volstagg''': To hell with treason. It's suicide.
*'''Sif''': Thor would do the same for us.
*'''Volstagg''': Shush! Heimdall might be watching.
*'''Heimdall''': You would defy the commands of Loki, our King? Break every oath you have taken as warriors, and commit treason to bring Thor back?
*'''Sif''': Yes.
*'''Heimdall''': Good!
*'''Sif''': So you'll help us?
*'''Heimdall''': [as he walks away from them] I am bound by honor to our King. I cannot open the bridge to you.
*'''Fandral''': Complicated fellow, isn't he?
*'''Volstagg''': Now what do we do?
*'''Sif''': Look! [they notice the bridge opening]
*'''Erik Selvig''': It's a beautiful theory, Jane. You won't be able to convince the scientific community of any of it. Not without hard evidence. [just then Volstagg knocks on the glass door and beside him are Fandral, Sif and Hogun]
*'''Volstagg''': Found you! [Thor looks up. Jane, Darcy and Erik are silent in shock, Erik drops his coffee cup]
*'''Thor''': My friends! [they all enter and Thor hugs Volstagg]
*'''Volstagg''': This is good! This is good!
*'''Erik Selvig''': I don't believe it!
*'''Volstagg''': Oh, excuse me. Lady Sif, and the warriors three.
*'''Thor''': My friends, I have never been happier to anyone. But you should not have come.
*'''Fandral''': We're here to take you home!
*'''Thor''': You know I can't go home. My father is...dead because of me. I must remain in exile.
*'''Sif''': Thor, your father still lives.
*'''Heimdall''': Tell me, Loki, how did you get the Jotuns into Asgard?
*'''Loki''': You think the Bifrost is the only way in and out of this realm? There are secret paths between the worlds, to which, even you with all your gifts are blind. But I have need of them no longer, now that I am king. And I say that for your act of treason, you are relieved of your duties as gatekeeper and no longer citizen of Asgard.
*'''Heimdall''': [he suddenly draws his sword and Loki with his new found powers freezes Heimdall] Then I need no longer obey you. [when they notice the giant killer robot Loki has sent to destroy them]
*'''Thor''': Jane, you have to leave.
*'''Jane Foster''': What are you gonna do?
*'''Thor''': I'm staying here.
*'''Fandral''': Thor is gonna fight with us.
*'''Thor''': [to Fandral, Volstagg, Sif and Hogun] My friends, I'm just a man. I'll only be in the way, or worse get one of you killed. But I can help get these people to safety.
*'''Jane Foster''': Well, if you're staying, then so am I.
*'''Thor''': We'll need some time.
*'''Fandral''': You'll have it.
*'''Darcy Lewis''': [as they others move away to help the people around them] Okay, move it people! [after Sif and the others have failed to destroy Loki's giant killer robot]
*'''Thor''': Sif, you've done all you can.
*'''Sif''': No! I will die a warrior death! Stories will be told of this day.
*'''Thor''': Live, and tell those stories yourself. [she cries in defeat] Now, go! [walking towards Loki's giant killer robot] Brother, whatever I have done to wrong you, whatever I have done to lead you to do this, I am truly sorry! But these people are innocent. Taking their lives will gain you nothing. So take mine and end this. [the giant killer robot's turns off his fire weapon and just as he turns to go he hits Thor hard] [flashback to Odin whispering to Thor's hammer before he banishes it from Asgard]
*'''Odin''': Whosoever holds this hammer, if he be worthy, shall possess the power of Thor. [as Thor lies dying from the impact of being hit by Loki's killer robot, his Hammer rises from where it was embedded in the stone and finds Thor to save him] [after Thor has regained his powers and is wearing his warrior costume with the red cape]
*'''Jane Foster''': So is this how you normally look?
*'''Thor''': More or less.
*'''Jane Foster''': It's a good look!
*'''Agent Coulson''': [walking towards Thor, who's dressed in his Asgardian warrior costume] Donald, I don't think you've been completely honest with me.
*'''Thor''': Know this, son of Coul. You and I, we fight for the same cause; the protection of this world. From this day forward you can count me as your ally, if, you return the items you have taken from Jane.
*'''Jane Foster''': Stolen!
*'''Thor''': Borrowed. [Coulson pauses from a moment before continuing] Of course you can have your equipment back. You're gonna need it to continue your research. Would you like to see the bridge we spoke of?
*'''Jane Foster''': Uh...sure. [he pulls Jane close to him and then flies with her in his arms towards the clouds]
*'''Thor''': I must go back to Asgard. But I give you my word, I will return for you. [he takes her and kisses it] Deal? [she suddenly kisses him passionately]
*'''Jane Foster''': Deal. [opening one of Odin's eyes as he sleeps]
*'''King Laufey''': It's said, you can still hear and see what transpires around you. I hope it's true, so that you may know your death came at the hand of Laufey. [just as he's about to strike and kill Odin, he gets strike down by Loki from behind]
*'''Loki''': And your death came by the son of Odin.
*'''Frigga''': [referring to Loki saving Odin from being killed by Laufey] Loki, you saved him. [she embraces Loki]
*'''Loki''': I swear to you mother, that they will pay for what they have done today. [just then Thor shows up]
*'''Thor''': Loki!
*'''Frigga''': Thor! I knew you'd return to us. [she runs towards him and embraces him]
*'''Thor''': Why don't you tell her? How you sent the Destroyer to kill our friends! To kill me!
*'''Frigga''': What?
*'''Loki''': Well, I must have been enforcing father's last command.
*'''Thor''': You're a talented lier, brother. Always have been.
*'''Loki''': It's good to have you back. Now, if you'll excuse me, I have to destroy Jotunheim.
*'''Thor''': Why have you done this?
*'''Loki''': To prove to father, that I am a worthy son! When he wakes, I will have saved his life. I will have destroyed that race of monsters. And I will be true heir to the throne!
*'''Thor''': You can't kill an entire race!
*'''Loki''': Why not? And what is this new found love for the Frost Giants? You? who could have killed them all with your bear hands.
*'''Thor''': I've changed.
*'''Loki''': So have I. [he hits Thor in the face with his spear] Now, fight me? [he hits Thor harder, making him fall] I never wanted the throne! I only ever wanted to be your equal.
*'''Thor''': [shouting] I will not fight you, brother!
*'''Loki''': I'm not your brother. I never was!
*'''Thor''': Loki, this is madness!
*'''Loki''': Is it madness? Is it? Is it? Come on, what happened to you on earth that turned you so soft? Don't tell me it was that woman? [Thor give him a look of anger] Oh! It was! Well, maybe when we're finished here, I'll pay here a visit myself. [angrily Thor suddenly charges towards him] [to Thor as he struggles to get close to the Bifrost to stop it from destroying Jotunheim] Look at you? The mighty Thor! With all your strength! And what good does it do you now? [Thor keeps on struggling forward] [shouting] Do you hear me, brother? There's nothing you can do! [after Thor has destroyed the bridge, Odin who's awakened, holds onto Thor and Loki hanging from the bridge] I could have done it, father! I could have done it! For you! For all of us!
*'''Odin''': No, Loki. [Loki looking dismayed loosens his grip on Odin's spear]
*'''Thor''': Loki, no! [he lets go and falls, disappearing into the darkness and the stars] [shouting] Noooo!
*'''Odin''': No.
*'''Sif''': My Queen, I'm so sorry for your loss. [referring to Thor] How is he?
*'''Frigga''': He mourns for his brother. And...he misses her, the mortal.
*'''Odin''': You'll be a wise king.
*'''Thor''': There will never be a wiser king than you. Nor a better father. I have much to learn. I know that now. Someday, perhaps, I shall make you proud.
*'''Odin''': You've already made me proud. [last lines; Thor approaches Heimdall, who's standing by the edge of the broken bridge]
*'''Thor''': So earth is lost to us?
*'''Heimdall''': No. There is always hope.
*'''Thor''': Can you see her?
*'''Heimdall''': Yes. [we see Jane, Erik and Darcy as they get ready to out on one of their field researchs]
*'''Thor''': How is she?
*'''Heimdall''': She searches for you. [lines after end of credits]
*'''Nick Fury''': Doctor Selvig?
*'''Erik Selvig''': So, you're the man behind all this? [he walks towards Fury] It's quite a labyrinth. I was thinking, they're taking me down here to kill me. [he laughs]
*'''Nick Fury''': I've been hearing about the New Mexico situation. Your work has impressed a lot of people who are much smarter than I am.
*'''Erik Selvig''': I have a lot to work with. The Forster theory, a gate to another dimension. It's unprecedented. Isn't it?
*'''Nick Fury''': Legend tell us one thing, history another. But every now and then we find something that belongs to both. [he opens a metal case to reveal the casket Odin had taken from Jotunheim]
*'''Nick Fury''': Power, doctor. If we can figure out how to tap it, maybe unlimited power. [as we see Erik's reflection in the nearby glass, we see Loki appear behind him not visible to anyone else]
*'''Loki''': [whispering] Well, I guess that's worth a look. [Erik repeats Loki's words]
*'''Erik Selvig''': Well, I guess that's worth a look.

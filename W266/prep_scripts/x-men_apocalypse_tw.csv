Charles,"Mutants, born with extraordinary abilities, and yet still, they are children, stumbling in the dark, searching for guidance. A gift can often be a curse. Give someone wings, and they may fly too close to the sun. Give them the power of prophecy, and they may live in fear of the future. Give them the greatest gift of all, powers beyond imagination, and they may think they are meant to rule the world."
Death,"Soon, you will rule forever, My Lord."
Egyptian Guard,DEATH TO THE FALSE GOD!
Horsemen of Apocalypse,Watch over him!
Teacher,"As everyone knows, the existence of mutants was first discovered during the Paris Peace Accords after the Vietnam war in 1973. 6 days later, we all watched as one of those mutants... Erik Lehnsherr, attacked the president and the cabinet on the lawn of the White House. Their lives were saved by a young mutant, who stopped him. Now, Lehnsherr escaped and became the world's most wanted fugitive. And as for her, she disappeared as well. But, she has become the symbol of a new age. The face of a world that will never be the same again."
Dude,You winking at my girl?
Teacher,"Yes, the world is panicked."
Scott,Your girl.
Teacher,... and there is still some prejudice.
Scott,I guess you do look old enough
Teacher,"But today,"
Scott,to be her father.
Teacher,"mutants are found in all walks of life. Excuse me, gentlemen, is there something that you would like to be sharing with the rest of the class?"
Scott,Can I please go to the bathroom. I think there's something seriously wrong with my eyes.
Teacher,"Fine, Scott, and afterward, why don't you stop by the principals office and explain to him that you're disrupting the class again. I trust you know the way."
Scott,"Yeah, I do."
Teacher,"Okay. (Bell rings) Oh. Hang on. Hang on. Now, I know most of you were what? Around 7 years old at that time."
Dude,Summers! I know you're in here. Are you crying? I haven't even kick your ass yet. Summers. You want to eyeball my girl? Summers. Summers.
Announcer,EAST BERLIN YES! 10 fights. 10 victories. The Winged Warrior. The Bird of Prey. The Angel of Death. ANGEL! Yes! A round of applause for fat boy!
Crowd,Boo!
Announcer," Our next opponent comes directly from Circus Munich. FIGH Ladies and gentlemen. The one who could face an Angel is the devil himself! Presenting. The amazing, the fantastic, Nightcrawler! Caution. High voltage. Sorry, mutants!"
Bodyguard,"Hey. You lost, little girl? The fight is there."
Angel,Fight! Or they'll kill us both.
Bodyguard,It's getting exciting.
Raven,"Ah, you mean this. Yeah?"
Crowd,Nightcrawler! - Nightcrawler! - Nightcrawler!
Nightcrawler,I'm sorry. I'm sorry!
Raven,Come with me.
Bodyguard,Hold it!
Raven,They went over there!
Nightcrawler,"You can transform. - You're her, the hero."
Raven,"I'm nobody. I'm not a hero. Let's get out of here. PRUSZKOW, POLAND"
Worker,"Have a good night, Henryk."
Erik,"Same to you, Milosz. Hi, my love."
Magda,Hi. Good day?
Erik,Better now. - Where's Nina?
Magda,At the back. With her friends.
Nina,"Where did you learn that song, Papa?"
Erik,"I learned it from my parents. And they learned it from their parents. And them from theirs. And one day, you will sing it to you children too."
Nina,"What happened to them, your parents?"
EriK,"They were taken from me, when I was a little boy. But, they are still here, inside. And here... with you."
Nina,Is someone going to take you away?
Erik,Never.
Alex,I guess we're more alike than we thought.
Woman,He won't listen to us. He just... He's been...
Alex,Scott. Let me try. XAVIER'S SCHOOL FOR GIFTED YOUNGSTERS
Scott,Smells pretty old in here. Is this a school or museum.
Alex,"One more, and last one. Oh."
Jean,(through telepathy) Watch where you're going.
Scott,I can't...
Alex,What? Who are you talking to?
Jean,Me.
Scott,I just heard you in my head.
Jean,"I'm telepathic, I read minds."
Scott,"Well, stay out of mine. I don't need some weird girl creeping around in there."
Jean,"Don't worry, Scott, there's not much to see."
Scott,"Hey, wait. I didn't tell you my name."
Jean,"No, you didn't."
Hank,Alex Summers?
Alex,Hank McCoy! Whoa. What happen to the big blue... furry you?
Hank,"I, keep it under control now."
Alex,"This is my brother, Scott."
Hank,"Hey, Scott. I'm Hank McCoy. I'm one of the teachers here. (Scott nods a little)"
Alex,Where's the Professor?
Charles,"... to break forth bloodily, then the past must be obliterated and a new start made. Let us now start fresh without remembrance, rather than live forward and backward at the same time. Now, what are the aggrieve things that the author meant when he wrote all that? He... That's going to be your assignment for tomorrow. Top marks, everyone. Class dismiss. Alex, it's good to see you."
Alex,"Yeah, you too."
Charles,You look... well. It's been a while.
Alex,It has. You're not too bad yourself.
Charles,Thank you.
Alex,"This is my brother, Scott."
Charles,"Hello, Scott. Welcome to the school for the gifted."
Scott,Yeah. It doesn't exactly feel like a gift.
Charles,"It never does, not at first. The first step in understanding one's power is learning the extent of it. Only then, can we begin the process of teaching you how to control it. If you do decide to stay, I can promise you that by the time you are done here you'll be able to go back into the world and play a stable productive partner. Why don't you take your bandages off and we can have a look at what we're dealing with here. Alex, would you line him up. Face him in the right direction if you will. There's a target just across the water. When you open your eyes, try and hit that. You can open your eyes, Scott. There's nothing to be afraid of. It's quite... Get back! Get back. Get back. Whoa! My grandfather planted that tree when he was 5 years old. I used to swing from the branches then myself. I think that was probably my favourite tree."
Scott,Does that mean I'm expelled?
Charles,On the contrary. You're enrolled.
Moira,Do you sell carpets?
Some Dude,You cannot come in here.
Moira,The carpet is for sale?
Some Dude,I said...
Worker,Earthquake!
Charles,"Back to bed, please, my darling. - Back to bed. -"
Hank,She's doing it again.
Charles,"Back to bed, please, everyone. Jessie, back to bed, please. Come on, now. Spitzbolt, back to bed. Carrie Anne, come on, now. Back to bed. - I've never seen her like this. -"
Hank,"Well, I do."
Charles,Don't let any of the children come this way. Jean. Jean! JEAN !!! I...
Jean,I saw the end of the world. I could feel all this death.
Charles,Nope. It was just a dream. -
Jean,"But, it felt real. -"
Charles,I know. Your mind is the most powerful I've ever seen. - It can convince itself... -
Jean,"No, it's not just a mind reading or a telekinesis, it's something else. Some... dark power inside and it's growing, like a fire. - I thought I was getting better. -"
Charles,You are. You will. - You just have to be patient. -
Jean,No. No. You don't know what it's like to be afraid to shut your eyes. - To be trapped inside your own head. -
Charles,"Oh, but I think I do. It wasn't so long ago, that I was plagued by voices of myself. All their suffering. All their pain. Their secrets."
Jean,I'm afraid one day I am going to hurt someone.
Charles,"Lie back. Everyone fears that which they do not understand. You will learn to control your powers. And when you do, you'll have nothing to fear."
Charles,Her nightmares were different this time.
Hank,"Well, it could have count for something I saw while I was in my lab earlier. There was some kind of tremor. Like an energy surge. - I picked it up on one of my meters. -"
Charles,You're saying that Jean created it.
Hank,"No, I'm saying something else did. Maybe she was reacting to it, I don't know. But, the Epicenter was half way around the world."
Charles,Half way around the world?
Hank,Yeah. That's why I was hoping you could take a look.
Charles,Let's see what we can find.
Computer,Welcome Professor.
Hank,The source came from Cairo. I'll put in the coordinates.
Moira,I got to get out of here and give them a report.
Hank,What? What is it?
Moira,"Something happened here, I can tell it's real."
Charles,It's her.
Hank,Who?
Charles,Moira.
Hank,What? - Moira MacTaggert?
Charles,Mm-hm.
Hank,And give me the details?
Charles,"Well, she looks amazing. - She's barely aged a day."
Hank,No. I meant... What is she doing there? What's the CIA doing with this?
Charles,"She's going back to Langley to deliver a report. I'm going to go there, see if she knows something about the tremor."
Hank,You'll wind up seeing Moira.
Charles,"I want to go check her out, check out... the situation. Moira MacTaggert. It's like a ghost from the past."
Magda,"You did a good thing, you saved that man."
Erik,"That's not the point. If I'm exposed, we're all exposed. We have to go."
Magda,This is our home. This is our daughter's home.
Erik,"We are her home. I told you who I was, the first night I met you. I trusted you then. I need you to trust me now. We can't stay here anymore."
Magda,I'll get Nina.  Sweetheart? She's not in her room. And I don't see her at the back.
Both,Nina! - Nina! - Nina! - Nina! Nina!
Erik,Nina. Are you okay?
Police Officer,She is fine.
Erik,"Then, let her go."
Police Officer,We will. We just wanted to talk.
Erik,You are not wearing your badges. No metal.
Police Officer,"Some men from the factory said they saw something today. Something that made no sense. Keep your weapons. You have been a good citizen, Henryk. A good neighbor, good worker. - I believe you are."
Magda,He is.
Police Officer,But nobody in town really knows who you are.
Erik,"Everyone knows. I'm Henryk Gurzsky. Jacob, I even had dinner at his house."
Jacob,And you lied all the time. I let a murderer in my house Is that you? Are you the one called Magneto?
Erik,I surrender. Please. Let my daughter go. Go with your mother.
Nina,Please! Don't leave me. - I'm not going to let them take you.
Magda,Nina. Nina. Nina. Nina.
Nina,Please!
Police Officer,What's happening? She is one of them.
Nina,Please.
Police Officer,Make her stop.
Erik,She can't control them.
Magda,Nina.
Nina,Please.
Erik,She's frightened.
Nina,I'm not letting them take you! I'm not letting them take you!
Police Officer,Make it stop!
Magda,Nina.
Erik,"No. No, Nina! . Nina? Nina. No. Don't... Please. Please. Please. What have you done? Not my babies. Not my babies. IS THIS WHAT YOU WANT FROM ME? Is this what I am? Is this what I am"
Merchant,You know what we do with thieves? Choose a hand.
Apocalypse,Enough.
Merchant,"If you are with her, I suggest you go away. Go away."
Apocalypse,Who rules this world?
Merchant,What language is that? Clown! What do you want? Go away! Sorry. Sorry.
Apocalypse,"You feel it, don't you? Now, you feel it. CENTRAL INTELLIGENCE AGENCY UNITED STATES OF AMERICA"
Alex,"So, you really haven't seen her in all these years? You never looked her up? Not even in Cerebro?"
Charles,"Alex. Who do you take me for? Some kind of pervert? I... Yes, I looked her up once. Twice. But, not in a long time."
Alex,Alright? How'd you leave things? - Any hard feelings?
Charles,"Not likely. Everybody take a break. I wiped her mind off all memories of us. The beach, Cuba, that whole time. It's so long ago, Alex. Before the world knew about mutants, I have felt... it was the best thing for her."
Alex,And for you?
Charles,It didn't really matter what's best for me. Moira MacTaggert.  Hello.  Allow me to introduce myself. I'm Professor...
Moira,Charles Xavier - I know exactly who you are.
Charles,You do?
Moira,Of course I do. I've read all of your papers. It's a pleasure to finally meet you.  - Moira MacTaggert.
Alex,Alex Summers.
Moira,"Have a seat. Just, throw that on the floor."
Charles,It's wonderful to see you again. To-To meet you again for the first time. I... You got a son? - Yes. - Does he have a husband or... Do you have a husband?
Moira,"I had a husband, but... It's hard to do this job and make it home in time for dinner."
Charles,"Good. Good. We all make choices, right?"
Moira,"Yes, we do. - Professor. - Yes?"
Charles,Yes. I was... we were hoping that you would tell us about what happened yesterday in Egypt.
Moira,"I'm afraid that's classified information. And, I don't mean to be rude, but... How did you get in here?"
Charles,I have level 5 clearance.
Moira,"Ever since the world found out about mutants in '73, there have been cults who see them as some kind of second coming or sign of god. I was tracking one of them. They called themselves, Ashir En Sabah Nur, named after an ancient being they believed to be the world's first."
Alex,The world first's what?
Moira,The world's first mutant.
Alex,I thought mutants didn't evolve until this century.
Moira,"That's the common theory, yes. But, these guys believe that the first mutant was born tens of thousands of years ago. And they believe he will rise again. They've been searching ancient sites all round the world for clues. These hieroglyphs described a specific set of powers greater than any man can possess."
Alex,They think he lived all that time?
Moira,"Yes and no. They believe he had the ability to transfer his consciousness from body to body, and whenever he was close to death he would just take on a new body. So, these may have been the bodies of mutants enabling him to take their powers amassing varies abilities over the years."
Charles,An all powerful mutant.
Moira,"Exactly. And wherever this being was, he always had 4 principle followers. Disciples. Protectors he would imbue their powers."
Alex,Like the Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse. - He got that one from the Bible.
Moira,"Or the Bible got it from him. And wherever he ruled, eventually, it would end in disaster. Cataclysm. Some kind of... Apocalypse."
Charles,The end of the world.
Star Trek Character,"I must say, Apollo. The way you ape human behavior is remarkable."
Storm,"Get out. Come one. Come on. Come on. I've never seen another mutant in this city. Do you speak Egyptian? Arab? English? Great fighter. She's my hero. I want to be like her. There's some food here, not much."
TV," I don't believe it. You love me. Love you? Be logical. I'm not some simple shepherdess you can awe. Why, I could no more love you than I could love a new species of... Bacteria."
Storm,What are you doing?
Apocalypse,Learning.
Reporter,"In the streets there is outrage against the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan... The brotherhood of our kind. One of them was held in Boston. Since the act in the nuclear weapons, the United States does not start fights..."
Apocalypse,Weapons?
Reporter,Never before has man possess so much power. With Soviet Union and the United States being superpowers...
Apocalypse,"Superpowers? The weak have taken the Earth. For this, I was betrayed. False gods. Idols. No more. I have returned. The new tomorrow, that starts today."
Storm,Where did you come from?
Apocalypse,The time before man lost his way.
Storm,Well. Welcome to the 80s.
Apocalypse,This world needs to be... Purged.
Storm,What?
Apocalypse,Saved.
Storm,"You can't save the world, just going around killing people. There's laws, system and place for that kind of thing."
Storm,"My child, why do you enslave yourself?"
Storm,What are you doing?
Storm,Making you stronger. My goddess.
Storm,Yes. You were right. The time has passed. There is no room for gods.
Kurt,Why can't I go with you.
Raven,"I told you, I work alone. Wait there."
Caliban,"Always good to see your face, even if it's not yours. Papers and passage for me. Where is the gentleman going, may I ask?"
Raven,"Don't matter, don't care. I just saved his life, what he does with it is up to him."
Caliban,"Mystique, the mercenary."
Raven,Don't call me that.
Caliban,"No matter how much you pretend to be someone else, Caliban knows who you are. If there's anything worth knowing about mutants, Caliban knows it."
Psylocke,Mystique.
Raven,Why don't you ask your psychics what will happen if you keep pushing me.
Caliban,"What will happen? Psylocke gets a little jealous. - 'Cause Caliban likes you. - Caliban likes money. Caliban likes you so much, he wants to give you free information. About an old friend. From back when you have friends. Do you remember, Erik Lehnsherr? My girls had a flash of him in Poland. He left quite a few dead bodies in his wake, including his wife and daughter. Should be on the news soon enough. But... Caliban gives you a little head start."
Raven,How fast are you?
Kurt,How fast?
Raven,How far can you cover?
Kurt,"Uh, as far as I can see, - or if I've been there before."
Raven,Come with me Crawler.
Kurt,"Actually it's Nightcrawler, and my real name is... ... Kurt Wagner."
Hank,"The lenses are made up of some ruby quartz I have lying around. They should be able to refract your optic beams and keep them contain within their own vector fields. Try them on. Okay, go ahead. Wait. Wait. Sorry, no. Okay."
Scott,Now?
Hank,"Yeah, you're good."
Scott,"Alright. Whoa. I can see. Thank you. Professor, thank you. You're a genius."
Hank,"No, I'm... not a professor. I wish."
Scott,Who's that?
Hank,"I believe you two have met, that's Jean Grey. You bumped into her when you arrived."
Scott,"Wait, that's her?"
Hank,Yeah.
Scott,Hey.
Jean,You can see.
Scott,Yeah. It's not as bad as I thought here.
Student 1,Freak.
Student 2,Someone should warn that new kid.
Scott,"They're still scared of me. Hey, I have special glasses now!"
Jean,"They're not scared of you, they're scared of me. You're not the only one who can't fully control your powers."
Scott,"Wait, so... Last night, when the house shook... That was you?"
Jean,"Sorry to break it to you, but you are not the biggest freak of this school."
Scott,Well. That's a first.
Hank,Raven. Wow. Uh. - I... You're...
Raven,Not blue? It's like you and I have that in common now.
Hank,"No. No, I meant... You're... You're back. I never thought I would see you here again."
Raven,"Yeah, me neither."
Kurt,I'm blue. I'm Kurt.
Raven,"Oh, right."
Kurt,Kurt Wagner.
Hank,Welcome.
Caliban,We're closed. I knew I felt a chill in the air. How did you get in here?
Storm,We let ourselves in.
Apocalypse,"We are looking for mutants. Since you know where to find them, we came here."
Caliban,Caliban doesn't know you.
Apocalypse,We are looking for the strongest.
Psylocke,Everything alright?
Caliban,"I'm fine, Psylocke. How much money do you have?"
Apocalypse,None.
Caliban,"Like Caliban said... We are closed, yeah?"
Apocalypse,"I need your help, my child."
Caliban,You don't look Caliban's father. Maybe a little bit up here.
Apocalypse,"You are all my children. And you are lost, because you follow blind leaders. These false gods. Systems of the weak. They ruined my world... ... no more."
Psylocke,What do you want?
Apocalypse,I want you... To feel the full reach of your power. You've only have a taste of your true strength. Unlike others who seek to control you. I want to set you free.
Psylocke,I know the kind of mutants you are looking for. And I know where to find them.
Kurt,It's my first time in America. I am very excited to see your culture.
Jubilee,"Well, you are not going to see it here. The only thing American about this place is that it used to be British. This is Scott. He is new here too."
Scott,And I'm already up for a prison break. What do you say we take this blue guy on a little field trip? I'm sure there's a mall around here somewhere.
Kurt,What's a mall?
Scott,What's a mall? Alright. Now it's a matter of national pride. - Civic duty.
Jean,Scott.
Scott,What? You've been cooped up here for a long time. And the Professor is not even home.
Kurt,I-I like to go to the mall.
Scott,Try it. - Alright. Where does he keep his cars?
Warren,"Faire pisse. Or should I say, ""Piss off""?"
Storm,This is the guy?
Psylocke,He used to be. I didn't know his wings were... Let's get out of here. His fighting days are done.
Apocalypse,"No, they're not."
Warren,What the hell is this?
Apocalypse,I want to give you something.
Warren,There is nothing you can give me that I want.
Apocalypse,"Yes, there is. Yes, my son. Yes. Rise, my angel. Rise."
Hank,"Hypersonic, blast resistance, stealth technology."
Raven,That's impressive. How are you ever gonna get it out of here?
Hank,"Well, that's okay. I built a retractable roof into the basketball court."
Raven,"Hank, you're building a warplane down here."
Hank,"After what happened in Washington, I thought we would come back to start the X-Men. Like we always talked about, but... Charles wants students not soldiers. He thinks the best of people. He has hope."
Raven,And you?
Hank,"You know, I think we should hope for the best. And prepare for the worst. I think the world needs the X-Men. Maybe, now that you're back you can help me convince him - ... we can start it together."
Raven,"Hank, I'm here about Erik."
Hank," Right. Erik. Yeah, of course. Of course."
Raven,I think he might be in some kind of trouble. Real trouble.
Hank,Isn't he always?
Erik,Some of you spoke to the police... About what your believed you witnessed here yesterday. You want to know my past? Know who I am? See what I can do? I'll show you. Think about the person you love most in your life. Your wife. Mother. Daughter. Now that person will know what it is to lose someone they love. And live with that pain. - Forever.
Worker,"Henryk, please. Don't do this."
Erik,"My name isn't Henryk. My name is Magneto. Who the fuck are you? Stay back. Whoever you are, don't try to stop me from killing these men."
Apocalypse,I'm not here for them. I'm here for you. Come and see. This is where your power was born. And this is where your people were slaughtered.
Erik,You shouldn't have brought me here.
Apocalypse,"Why? Are you afraid to be here? You can't escape it, Erik."
Erik,Who are you?
Apocalypse,"Elohim, Shen, Ra. I've been called many names over many lifetimes. I am born of death. I was there to spark and fan the flame of man's awakening, to spin the wheel of civilization. And when the forest would grow rank and in need of clearing for new growth... I was there to set it ablaze."
Erik,Where were you? When my father and mother were slaughtered in this place?
Apocalypse,"Asleep. Trapped in darkness. I was not there for you, my son. But I am here now. You don't know your own strength, but I do. Reach down. Feel the metal in the ground. Reach, as deep as you can. You'll find you have the power to move the very Earth itself. Everything they've built will fall! And from the ashes of their world, we'll build a better one!"
Reporter,"Lehnsherr was identified yesterday in this small town, in central Poland. Leaders from all communities are urging their citizens to remain calm as police and armed forces are mobilizing to find Lehnsherr before he can strike again. If anyone has information about Lehnsherr, or as he is also known as Magneto. Contact you local authorities immediately. And proceed with caution. - As he is considered extremely dangerous."
Peter's Mom,Peter.
Peter,What's up?
Peter's Mom,I'm just checking on you.
Peter,"I'm good, playing Pac-Man."
Peter's Mom,Are you sure you weren't watching this?
Reporter,The world was celebrating 10 years of peace between mutants and mankind.
Peter's Mom,"You're going after him, aren't you?"
Peter,"You wanted me to get out of the house more, right?"
Peter's Mom,I can't stop you.
Peter,Nobody can.
Peter's Mom,Trust me. This won't end well. Nothing does with him.
Peter,I'm not afraid of him.
Peter's Mom,You should be. XAVIER'S SCHOOL FOR GIFTED YOUNGSTERS
Moira,"I've read so much about this place. But being here, it actually seems kind of... ... familiar."
Charles,It's strange. - It could be quite. Shall we? NOW PLAYING THE RETURN OF THE JEDI
Jubilee,"I'm just saying, ""The Empire"" is still the best. It's the most complex, the most sophisticated, wasn't afraid to have a dark ending."
Scott,"Yeah, but come on. If it wasn't for the first one you wouldn't have any of the rest of the movies."
Jean,"Well, at least we can all agree the third one is always the worst."
Charles,Hank. You in here? I'd like you to meet the...
Raven,Moira.
Charles,Raven?
Moira,"I'm sorry, have we met?"
Charles,"Hank, Alex, agent MacTaggert, would you give us just one moment please?"
Moira,Of course.
Raven,"Charles, why didn't she recognize me? She knew me in this form."
Charles,"Well. After you left me on the beach in Cuba, I took her memories of that time. Have a sit."
Raven,Lucky girl.
Charles,"It's good to see you, Raven. - Welcome home."
Raven,This isn't my house.
Charles,It was once.
Raven,"No, it was your home. I just lived here. I barely even recognize it now."
Charles,"Yeah, I have plans for this place. I mean to turn it into a real campus. A university. Not just for mutants, even for humans too. Living and working, ... growing together."
Raven,"You know, I really believed that once. I really believed we can change them after DC."
Charles,We did.
Raven,No Charles. They still hate and fear us. It's just harder to see because they're more polite about it. I got sick of living that lie.
Charles,That's why you're not in your natural blue form.
Raven,I'm not going to be the face of a world that doesn't exist.
Charles,Things are better. The world is better.
Raven,"Maybe in Westchester. Out there, mutants are still running, hiding, living in fear. Just because there's not a war doesn't mean there's peace. If you want to teach your kids something, teach them that. Teach them to fight. Otherwise, they might as well live in this house for the rest of their lives."
Charles,You still sound just like him. You sound just like Erik.
Raven,That's why I'm here. He's resurfaced. He had a wife and a daughter. They were killed. Along with a handful of policemen. The whole world will be looking for him. But you can help me find him before they do.
Charles,"Moira, I'm going to have to ask you to keep this a secret."
Moira,I don't even know what this... is.
Raven,It's Cerebro. - The new model.
Hank,Yeah. I based the color on... It doesn't matter.
Moira,What are those?
Charles,Those are all the humans of the world. And these... ... are all the mutants. I'm connected to all of their minds.
Moira,The CIA would kill for this.
Charles,"I know they would. Where are you, Erik?"
Erik,Charles?
Charles,"Hello, old friend. I'm sorry. I am so sorry. I feel your pain. And your loss."
Erik,"You think, because you can see into my head... ... you know how it feels? You are looking in the wrong place, Charles."
Charles,"What happened to them, it was terribly wrong. But, come back to us. I can help you."
Erik,Help me?
Charles,"Think of your wife, think of your daughter. - What would they have wanted?"
Erik,"They would have wanted to live. I tried your way, Charles. I tried to be like them. Live like them. But it always ends the same way. They took everything away from me. Now... We'll take everything from them."
Charles,Hank. He's not alone.
Apocalypse,Extraordinary.
Warren,What do you see?
Apocalypse,The answer.
Charles,Oh my god.
Apocalypse,Thank you for letting me in.
Hank,"Charles. Charles, get out! Charles? Charles I have never felt power like this before."
Hank,"Charles. Charles, get out!"
Raven,What's going on? What's happening?
Hank,I think... Someone's taken over Cerebro. - They've taken control of it.
Raven,To do what?
Hank,To connect.
Apocalypse,It's always the same. And now all this. No more stones. Not more spears. No more slings. No more swords. No more weapons! No more systems! No more! No more superpowers.
Hank,Charles!
Raven,Hank!
Government Official,What the hell is going on? Who's turning the keys?
Director,The men are.
Government Official,Who agreed with the launch?
Raven,"Hank, do something!"
Hank,It won't shut down!
Government Official,We've lost contact with the Trident and Polaris subs. The Air Force is reporting the same thing.
Apocalypse,They put so much faith in their... tools and their... machines.
Government Official,"Russia, China, England, Israel, India. Everybody's got nukes in the air."
Black Official,What's the target? Where are they going?
Director,Up. Straight up.
Charles,Alex.
Alex,What?
Charles,Destroy it! Destroy everything! Destroy Cerebro! Wreak havoc.
Apocalypse,You can fire your arrows from the Tower of Babel. BUT YOU CAN NEVER STRIKE GOD!
Moira,"Charles. Charles, are you okay?"
Raven,Erik. Charles!
Hank,Alex!
Alex,"Hey! Hey, asshole!"
Apocalypse,"All will be revealed, my child."
Alex,Stop!
Hank,NO!
Peter,Wow!
Hank,Where... Where did you...?
Peter,I was looking for the Professor. I thought he lived here.
Hank,They took him away.
Student 3,She's the one.
Student 4,That's her.
Student 5,Are you sure?
Student 6,Is she going to help us?
Hank,They look up to you. Right now. They need you.
Raven,That's not what they need.
Student 7,Whoa! That's far out.
Scott,What happened? Where's Alex? Where's my brother?
Alex,I'm pretty sure I got everybody.
Hank,Alex was closest to the blast.
Scott,Alex.
Solider,"We're 1 click out. Alright, boys. This is it."
Computer,Please remain calm. Scott. Medical assistance is on the way. Please remain calm. Medical assistance is on the way. Please remain calm. Medical assistance is on the way. Please remain calm. Medical assistance is on the way.
Moira,"Hey! Moira MacTaggert, CIA! Thank God you're here!"
Raven,WAIT !
William,Fire! I want her! Him! Him! - And her!
Solider,"Yes, sir."
William,Leave the kids.
Kurt,What do we do? -
Jean,Keep quiet.
Solider,"X-Ray 7, I'm doing a final sweep on the ground. Alright, you! Are you clear? Clear!"
Solider," Pack them up. Let's go. Come on, let's move!"
Scott," Thanks, Jean. We got to help them. - Kurt, can you get us in that thing?"
Kurt, - You want to get in there? What if the soldiers see us?
Jean," Don't worry. They won't see us, trust me."
Kurt, Hold on.
Scott," Kurt, get us all out of here! I can't! When they closed the doors, there's some kind of electric field. - It's like Berlin all over. Scott: - Jean, get into the pilots heads. - Don't let them take off! Jean: - I can't. I can't reach the pilots. I can't reach anyone. News reporter: We're also getting reports from Europe and Asia. This was not just the US phenomenon. It seems the entire world has been disarmed of nuclear weapons. The Pentagon has confirmed multiple launches from Russia, as well as the UK, Israel and China. Student 8: - Look! - Up there. News reporter: So far, there has been no response from the White House. Eye witness accounts have been pouring in from across the globe. Authorities are not sure if it was an act of peace or an act of war. Kurt: Dear Father. Hold me in the light of God. Scott: It should have been me. He was the one who's going to do something with his life. He was always the one. Jean: That's not how he felt. He felt you were the one who's going to do something special with your life. That you're going to make a difference in the world. Maybe even change it. Scott: How did you know what he felt? I know what everybody feels. Kurt: Hold me in the light of God. Protect me from danger. Save me by your command. Listen to my prayer. And keep me safe."
Charles," You're blocking me. How? Apocalypse: I can shield their minds from your power. It's one of the many gifts I have acquired through out the millennia. But to... see... inside a mind. To control it. That's your gift. You saw it, didn't you? The glory of what's to come. Charles: Are you going to take part in all this killing? Destruction?"
Erik," - It's all I ever known. Charles - No, it isn't. - You've just forgotten."
Erik," - No, Charles, I remember. Your way doesn't work. Apocalypse: I showed him a better way. A better world."
Charles," No, you just tapped into his rage and pain. That's all you've done. I told you from the moment I met you, there's more to you, Erik. There is good in you too. Erik: Whatever it is you think you saw in me, Charles. I buried it. With my family."
Peter, - What? - What? What's wrong with you? Is that going to happen to all of us?
Hank," No, I just left my meds in the house."
Moira,"- What happened? Where we are? Raven: - Hey. Hey! William: - Hello, Mystique. Raven: - Major Stryker. William: Colonel Stryker. I wouldn't get too close to the wall if I were you. It may create some... discomfort."
Moira," I'm Moira MacTaggert. I'm a senior officer at the CIA. William: I know who you are, agent MacTaggert. Moira: - You cannot keep me here in this..."
William," - Actually, I can. A psychic event just destroyed every nuke from here to Moscow. That event emanated from exactly where we found you. At the home of the world's most powerful psychic. So, you're going to tell me. Where is Charles Xavier? Moira: It's not him you should be worried about. There's someone else. Someone more powerful. Raven: If you let us out of here, we can help you. William: Do you really expect me to believe that? You can put on any face that you want, but I know who you are. What you are. Hank: Hey, Moira. Mm. What did you mean when you said someone more powerful than Charles?"
Soldier 10," Once he finished this, we'll go from there. Scott: What's taking so long? Kurt: I can't get in. It has a field around it like the helicopter. Scott: There's got to be a way to cut the power. Apocalypse: Charles, you will send a message to every living mind. You will tell them that this Earth will be laid waste. That it is I, En Sabah Nur, who wreak this upon them. Now. Deliver my message. Charles: Even if I wanted to, I couldn't reach that many people. I don't have Cerebro. Apocalypse: You don't need a machine... to amplify your powers. You have me. Scott: Guys, that could be our way out of here. Peter: You know him? Magneto. Raven: I used to. I'm not so sure anymore. Peter: What was he like? Was he... like they say he was? Was he a... ... bad guy? Raven: No. I mean, yeah. He was... Why do you care so much? Did you see his speech on TV or something? Peter: Yeah, but... He's my father. Raven: What? Peter: - He and my mom, they... Raven: - Yeah, I know. But... Are you sure? Peter: Yeah. Yeah. yeah. He left my mom before I was born. I met him 10 years back, but I didn't know it was him. By the time I figured it out, it was too late, you know. Then, this week I saw him on TV again. And, I came to their house looking for him. But, by the time I got there... Late again. You know, for a guy who moves as fast as me, I always seem to be too late. Raven: Let's hope not this time. Peter: Yeah. Seriously. Charles: Hear me, inhabitants of this world. Scott: - What is this? Charles: - This is a message. Jean: I think it's the Professor. Charles: A message to every man, woman and mutant. Apocalypse: You have lost your way. Charles: You have lost your way. Apocalypse: But I have returned. Charles: But I have returned. The day of reckoning, it is here. All your buildings... All your buildings and temples... ... will fall. The dawn of a new era will emerge. For there is nothing you can do... - Jean. - ... to stop what is coming. Jean, if you can hear me, focus on my voice. Cairo. Find us. Jean, find us. Cairo. Find us. Jean. This message is for one reason alone. Apocalypse: To tell the strongest among you... Those with the greatest power. This earth will be yours. Charles: Those with the greatest power. Protect those without. That's my message to the world. Hank: That was Charles doing that without Cerebro."
Solider," Sir, what was that voice? William: I know that voice. It's Xavier, isn't it? What's going on? Raven: - We don't know! Peter: - We don't know, bro! Jean: He just spoke to me. Scott: - I think he spoke to everyone. Kurt: - I can hear him too. Jean: No, no. He just sent me a hidden message. One he knew only I would hear. I know where they are."
Solider," Hey! Solider: Shots fired! Where's it coming from? Solider: I have intruders in quad 6. William: Send a security team and take them out. Scott: The generator. It's worth a shot. Jean: Kurt? Scott: There's some kind of animal in there. Jean: It's no animal. It's a man. Kurt: Who is he? Jean: A part of himself has been taken away. Scott: What do you mean? Jean: I mean, they turned him into... ... some kind of weapon. Solider: Charlie 3, report. Did you find them? Solider: Turn it down. Solider: Fire! Solider: Weapon X is loose. I repeat. Weapon X is loose. Scott: You sure he's not an animal? Solider:- He's in the central halls. - Engaging target, Sector 5. We can't stop h... ! Solider: Hey! Moira: - What are they doing? Hank: - What's going on? Solider: I just lost the feed. - What's going on here? - Hey! William: I'll be right back. Solider: Move!"
Solider," Hey! Stay where you are! Jean: Scott, wait. I can help you. Scott: Jean. Jean: Logan. Logan. Scott: What did you do to him? Jean: I found a piece of his past and gave it back to him. Just a few memories I could reach. Scott: I hope that's the last we'd seen of that guy."
Hank," Kurt. Moira: - What? Peter: - What? Kurt: Hey. Stay away from the... Hank: The what? Kurt: Th... door... Stay away from the... Raven: - Get away from the door! Peter: - The door! The door! Kurt: On three. One. Two. Jean: We know where the Professor is. Scott: I think we might have a way out of here. Raven: Well, you've been busy. Scott: We had a... a little help. Let's go. Kurt: - Watch out! Peter: - Jesus! Kurt: Oh, sorry. Scott: This way. Apocalypse: This was meant to be the center of the universe before I was betrayed. Now. It will be."
Hank,"Nice. Raven: Hey, Hank. Do you think you can fly this thing? Hank: Yeah, I can figure it out Scott:. Hey, guys. Flight suits. Raven: You got your warplane. Let's go to war. Apocalypse: A gift... From the past you left behind. And the future that lies ahead. You, will reach down, my son, deep into the Earth. Rip everything they built from the ground. Wipe clean this world. And we will lead those that survived. Into to a better one. Charles: And me? Am I to play a role in this madness? Apocalypse: You have the most important role of all. Jean: Were you scared? That day in DC, were you scared? Raven: No. But I was scared on my first mission. I was on a plane like this with my friends. About your age. We called ourselves the X-Men. Your brother was there. We used to call Havoc. He was a real handful, but... When it came down to it, he was very brave. Kurt: What happened to the rest of the kids that went with you? The X-Men. Hank: Hank and I are the only ones left. I couldn't save the rest of them. I told you, I'm not a hero. Jean: Well, you're a hero to us. Seeing you that day on TV changed my life. Kurt: My too. Peter: My too. I mean, I still live in my mom's basement, but... Everything else is... Well, it's pretty much the same. I'm a total loser. Scientist: What we're seeing is a magnetic phenomenon on a much larger scale than we saw in Auschwitz. The ground is full of magnetic elements. Iron, nickel, cobalt. The ocean's floor is lying with them too. It's already begun, at the lowest depths. Land masses will slow it, but not for long. Eventually, cities, urban centers. Anything built since the Bronze Age will be wiped away. The death toll will be billions. General: He's talking about the whole god damn world. Charles: You're just another false god. And whoever's left to follow you when this is all over. They will betray you again. Apocalypse: You're wrong, Charles. For the first time in a thousand lifetimes... I have you. For all my gifts, I've yet to possess the one I needed most. To be... everywhere. To be... everyone. Hank: Seventh wonder, 12 o'clock. Jean: He has the Professor in the center of the pyramid. He's going to transfer his consciousness into the Professor. If he does that, he'll have the power to control every mind in the world. Moira:What the hell is that? Raven: It's Erik. You guys help Nightcrawler get into the pyramid. Get Charles. I'll take care of Erik. Hank: How are you going to get through that? Peter: I can get you in there. I came here for him. Let me help you. Raven: The rest of you, get Charles on this plane and get him out of here."
Nightcrawler," - We're not leaving without you! Peter: - Don't worry. We'll catch up. Raven: Hold on. Raven: Hank, you go with the kids. - Moira will be waiting on the plane. Scott: - Wait. Raven: What? Scott: Not all of us can fully control our powers. Raven: Then, don't. You need to embrace them. We all do. Apocalypse: Go, join the others. Protect me until the transference is complete. Hank: There's an entrance. It's clear. Kurt. Get in there! Hank: In the pyramid. Move! Go! Psylocke: Split them up. Jean: Professor. Kurt, you have to hurry! Kurt: I'm trying. It's like a maze in here. Jean: Kurt, no! Peter: The magnetic field is too strong, I can't get us in there. Raven: Erik! Erik: Mystique. Raven: I know you think you've lost everything. But, you haven't. You have me. You have Charles. You have more family than you know. You never had the chance to save your family before. But you do now. That's what I've come here to tell you. Erik: And you? Peter: I'm your... I'm here for my family too. Charles: Get out! Get out! GET OUT !!! Kurt: Arrivederci. Jean: We're losing him. Kurt: I'll be right back. Scott, glasses on! Hank: Let's go! Hank: - Lock on. Moira: - Here we go. Angel: Psylocke! Moira: What the hell was that? Jean: Kurt. Everyone grab hold of Nightcrawler! Kurt: I've never done it with this many people. Jean: Get us out of here. Kurt, hurry! Kurt! Raven: Charles. Scott: Is he okay? Jean: It's his energy. He's drained. Charles: No. Get out. Get... Get out!"
Jean,"Professor. Professor, it's okay. You're with us. It's okay. Raven: I'm going to go fight for what I have left. Are you?"
Charles,"(During a flashback Erik has) There's so much more than you than you know. Not just pain and anger. There's good too. I felt it. It's not just me you're walking away from. Here you have the chance to be part of something much bigger than yourself. And it needs you, Erik."
Apocalypse, Useless. Apocalypse: Charles. I know you can hear me. We're still connected. Charles! Show yourself! CHARLES! SHOW YOURSELF! Apocalypse: Foolish child.
Charles,"Peter. Apocalypse: End him. Charles: Raven. Apocayplse: The great hero. Hank: - I'm going out there. Scott: - I'm going with you. Charles: No. - It's me he wants. Moria: - Charles, you can't give yourself up. If he has you, he has us all. The whole world. Apocalypse: You are feeble. Just like the others. Charles! Come! Rescue your weakling! Give your life, for their's! Charles: No. He was right. There is still some part of me connected to him."
Apocalypse, Charles! Charles: I can get inside his head. Apocalypse: Will you do nothing? Charles: Thank you for letting me in. You want what I have? You want to feel what I feel? Welcome to my world! You're in my house now! Apocalypse: You'll need a bigger house. You betray me? Erik: No. I betrayed them.
Hank,"Let's jump. Scott: What? Hank: Cover me. I got you. Peter: Come on! Apocalypse: They lack strength, Charles. Charles:Jean. Apocalypse: Come here. Charles: Help... Me. Hank: Stay here. Moira: They can't stop him. Charles: Jean. Help me! Scott: Hank! Hank! Apocalypse: It's over, Charles. You're finished. You're mine now. Charles: You will never win. Apocalypse: And why is that? Charles: Because you are alone. And I am not! Let ... go. Unleash your power, Jean. No fear. Unleash your power! Let go, Jean! Jean, let go! Hank: He's getting away. Apocalypse: All is revealed. Moira: Charles! Charles! - We've lost him! Hank: - Charles. Moira: - He's gone. Hank: - No, Charles. Charles... Jean: No, he's not. I can still feel him. Charles: Thank you, Jean. Moira: Charles? Charles, do you know where you are? Charles: I'm on a beach. In Cuba. With you. Moira: What beach?"
